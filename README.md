Learn python using projects
I made this very basic game that makes use of modules like pygame,random and math
In ths game you will have to destroy the alien UFOs using your spacship that can only move on the X axis
press arrow keys to change direction and spacebar to shoot
DO NOT LET THE ENEMIES COME TOO CLOSE,OTHERWISE YOU'LL LOSE!
